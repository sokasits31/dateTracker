# Date Tracker

# Dan,Kia,Steve Team Project

### Problem Statement

Many people forget about important events they would like to remember.  To remedy this we
will create an event tracker that will tell a user what events are going to occur within a
specific time period.  The user will enter a specific number of days in the future or an
event type.  The service will then return all of the events that match the criteria entered.
The returned list will include the event name, event type, and event date.
