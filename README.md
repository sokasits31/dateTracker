# Nelneters Team Project

### Problem Statement:

Many people forget about important events they'd like to remember.  To remedy this,
it would be nice to be able to track all special events within a specific time period.
To accomplish this, we will create an event tracker that will tell a user what events
are going to occur within a specific number of days.  The user will enter a specific
date in the future, or a number of days in the future, or an event type.  The service
will then return all of the events that match the criteria entered.  The returned list
will include the event name, event type, and event date.
